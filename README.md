# FrontEnd

## Pre-Requistes:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on the system
* npm installed (usually bundled with node.js installer, so you may not have to do anything here). 
* Type `node -v` and `npm -v` on Command Prompt/Terminal and make sure it displays both versions.
* [BackEnd code](https://github.com/SER531-Team07/BackEnd) is downloaded, set up and server is running.


## Setup Instructions for local machine.

* Save the file.
* Open Terminal/Command Prompt and run the following commands:
    * `npm install`
    * `npm test`
* You can see the application running at `http://localhost:3000` on your web browser.
